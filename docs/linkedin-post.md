## Option A (Launch Post)
I am happy to share **WinGet-PSADT GUI Packaging Tool** as an open-source project for Intune/endpoint admins.

It streamlines the full flow:
- search WinGet packages
- scaffold PSAppDeployToolkit structure
- configure deployment logic by phase
- generate `.intunewin`
- upload to Intune

One feature I focused on heavily: **PSADT function discoverability in UI**.
Functions are grouped into practical categories so engineers can configure faster with less trial-and-error:
- User Interface
- Registry
- File System
- Shortcuts
- Services
- User Context / Profiles
- Environment / System
- Configuration / INI
- Logging
- Security / Permissions
- Application Detection / Management
- Browser Extensions
- Process Execution
- MSI / MSP / MST
- Core Toolkit Engine

If you work on Intune app packaging at scale, feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Option B (Feature Spotlight)
Most packaging tools expose commands but not structure.

In **WinGet-PSADT GUI Packaging Tool**, PSADT functions are categorized in UI so the operator can navigate by intent, not by memory.

This reduces config mistakes and speeds up delivery across install/uninstall/repair phases.

If this helps your packaging workflow, I would like your feedback.
