# PSADT Template Placeholder

This folder is intentionally kept minimal for open-source compliance.

Do not commit PSAppDeployToolkit module binaries, vendor installers, or generated deployment payloads.

At runtime, the tool builds package templates using installed PSAppDeployToolkit (`New-ADTTemplate`).

Expected local-only subfolders:
- `Assets/`
- `Config/`
- `Files/`
- `SupportFiles/`
